# ShipsOfBattle
CSSE432 Final Project

To run the app, Xcode on a Mac computer is required. The link to the code repository is here: https://github.com/pran09/ShipsOfBattle.git
Get the code from the repository and open the project in Xcode. You will need two devices to play the game properly (one iPhone and a simulator
on the Mac is fine). Install the program on both devices through Xcode and the game is ready to play. Have Fun!!!
